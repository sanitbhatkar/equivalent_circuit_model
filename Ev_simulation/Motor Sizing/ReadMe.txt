# Motor Sizing

Full electic vehicle has many subsections which are to be modelled with approprate physics. Each subsystem demands power from the battery pack. By simple kinematic equations one can have rough estimate of battery power and motor requirements. Drive cycle can be fed to the code to get the operating range of the motor.
